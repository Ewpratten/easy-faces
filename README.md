Tools for face classification

## About this project
This repo contains the common scripts I use to quickly build classifiers for people's faces, and a little visualization tool to check the results

## Using
The following commands will run the scripts
```
make train
    - Records data from the webcam to the dataset
make build
    - Builds a new model YML file from the dataset
make vis
    - Visualize the model form video through the webcam
```
